               <div class="about-block">Hello! I’m Surabhi Rupani, and it's a pleasure to meet you. I recently pursuing Mobile Application Design and Development course from Lambton college located in Toronto. While there, I studied topics such as iOS programming, Android fundamentals, object oriented programming concepts, Wen browser application, and more. I was also part of the student government, and maintained a GPA of 3.5.
                  I’ve worked hard in my education which has prepared me well for my future, and now I’m ready to apply what I’ve learned. Even though I don’t have any real-life work experience, I have gained valuable insight into the business world.
                  Many of my classes involved solving real-world problems with real companies. At this point in my career, I would like to utilize everything I’ve learned at college and get some hands-on experience.</div>
